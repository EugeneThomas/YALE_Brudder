We will be working to create a web log hosting site, where users can create, edit and view blogs. This will be implemented using sophisticated interaction between SQLite, Flask and HTML.

#### RUNNING OUR APP: ####
1. Check that you've cloned our repo! If not:
`git clone https://github.com/EugeneThomas/YALE_Brudder.git`
2. Make sure your terminal session has flask installed, otherwise open up a virtual server that does
3. (In our repo) Type in `python app.py`
4. Open up a web browser, and head towards localhost:5000 (type in your URL bar)
5. Have fun! Make a new account, view some blogs, make your own - the sky's the limit.

3. SQLite (interwebs)
